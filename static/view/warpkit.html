<p>Warpkit is an encryption library providing esoteric support for encryption.</p>
<p>Warpkit focuses primarily on encryption techniques and not on cracking and exploration.</p>
<p>Warpkit is however mostly in the crash phase: most features exist in code somewhere, lost or findable, and can easily be recreated.</p>
<p>Features include mapped dynamic compression, nop emplacement, alphabet translation, static library transliteration, and watermarking.</p>
